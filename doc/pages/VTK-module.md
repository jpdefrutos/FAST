VTK module {#vtk-module}
=====================

The VTK module allows connecting VTK and FAST image pipelines.

## Usage
Set FAST_MODULE_VTK to ON in CMake to enable this module, if CMake is unable to find VTK automatically you will have to set VTK_DIR in CMake to where you have VTK installed on your system.

Tested with version VTK 7.1
